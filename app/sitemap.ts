 * NOTE ON TRAILING SLASHES
 * next.config.ts sets `trailingSlash: true`, so `/docs` redirects to `/docs/`.
 * Canonical URLs therefore carry a trailing slash - keep it that way here.
 *
 * NOTE ON HREFLANG
 * There are none, and that is deliberate. This site was previously published in
 * English and German with paired alternates; the German half was removed. A
 * single-language site must not declare `languages` at all, because an alternate
 * that names a page which no longer exists tells search engines an alternate
 * exists and then fails to deliver it. /de/* now 301s to the English
 * equivalent - see public/_redirects.
 *
 * NOTE ON /report/
 * The scan result page is user-specific and thin content. It is deliberately
 * NOT listed here, and is disallowed in robots.txt.
